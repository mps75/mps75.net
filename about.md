Hi, my name is Matt Swanson and this is my blog -- thanks for visiting!

I grew up in North Dakota and lived in the Midwest (Fargo and Minneapolis) until my wife and I moved to Southern California in 2001.  I've spent most of my adult life working in IT as a system administrator and later as a solution architect.

In our mid-thirties we decided to get serious about a lifestyle redesign.  We sold our house and a majority of our non-essential "stuff" and moved into a small apartment.  A couple years later we downsized even more and moved into our friends' guest house.  This downsizing, along with many years of saving, scrimping, and investing, gave us the opportunity to quit our corporate jobs this past year.  So we've been traveling, volunteering, mountain biking, and really just spending time doing the things we love.

I've been blogging on-and-off since 2002, but decided to start fresh since most of my old content was stale (and, if I'm being honest with myself, probably not that great).  I ditched my previous Wordpress-based hosting setup in favor of a Jekyll-based static site, which is what you're currently viewing.

Thanks again for stopping by.  Feel free to say hi on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mps75) or [Instagram](https://instagram.com/mps75).
