Hello world.

It's a tradition to print out "Hello world" in your first program when you're learning a new programming language.  So I figured this was an appropriate way to kick off my revamped blog.  As I mentioned in my little [about]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link about.md %}) blurb, I've actually been blogging for a long time, but have been on a bit of a hiatus for a couple years.  I stopped working recently (more on that later) and now that I have some more time was going to pick things back up again and maybe even redesign my site.  After thinking about it a bit, though, I decided to scrap my old Wordpress setup and do something completely different (more on that later, too).  I also decided to not migrate any of my old content since it's a) old and b) kind of shitty.  I might change my mind in the future and pull some old stuff over, but probably not.

Anyway, on a related note, I was watching this short [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7Lg0QjkAHc&t=47s) recently where Matt D'Avella was interviewing someone named Caroline Lee.  She makes a comment that she feels bad these days when people say they started blogging since it's, and I'm paraphrasing, "so over."  I generally really dig Matt's videos and absolutely loved "Minimalism" so this belittling tone struck me as kind of lame.  Especially for someone who talks a lot about being creative and following your own path, etc.  I mean, they're probably right -- blogging isn't as cool as it used to be and there also probably way too many blogs out there.  And nowdays it seems like no one has time to read anything longer than a tweet or a facebook post so what's the point of blogging?

First, I'm probably a bit different than what these two are talking about.  I don't think anyone will ever read this blog and I'm definitely not trying to create a "personal brand" or become an "influencer."  I'm not trying to make any money doing this and I don't really care about any of that kind of "online presence" stuff.  I've always held the view that I blog for myself because it helps me clarify my thoughts, improves my writing, gives me the chance to learn some new web development stuff, and, not least of all, is pretty fun.  Is it nice when a person or two actually reads something I write and maybe gets something out of it?  Yeah, of course!  But that's really not why I do it.  Having a (public) forum to work on my writing and web dev skills is helpful in and of itself.  Now that I'm not working I'm not writing nearly as much so I'm trying to get in the habit of doing some kind of writing, at least a few times a week.  Most of this is just private stuff that lives on my harddisk, but some of it will go on this very blog.

So, here's the the early 2000s.  Let's blog.
