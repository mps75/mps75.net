I've been thinking a bit about comfort and personal growth lately and was reminded of something in Neal Stphenson's [*Anathem*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2845024-anathem). The story is kind of long and complicated so I won't try to explain it here and, truthfully, the stuff I'm talking about is really just a small aside and not really a part of the larger story.

Anyway, in the story there's this ancient monastic order that has dedicated themselves to a type of martial arts. The order is called the "Ringing Vale" and their martial arts practice is referred to as "vlor," (short for "Vale Lore").  They have this concept of something called "emergence," which is described in the book as, "The idea being that all the training in the world was of no use, maybe even worse than useless, if you did not know when to use it...."  I'm not sure that quote completely captures the concept so here's my interpretation.

Basically the members of this order spend crazy amounts of time training and practicing hand-to-hand combat. They dedicate their lives to learning everything they can about their art. But training and studying in isolation is pretty empty. You need to apply your skills and knowledge in a real-world situation in order to find out what you can really do. So after putting in all of the work and going through all of the preparation your goal should be to seek out opportunities to put it into practice.  You should run towards problems to see if you have what it takes to solve them and you should seek out uncomfortable situations rather than turn away from them.

misc thoughts:
I'd be willing to wager that most people tend to view the good life as having the least amount of stress and discomfort. We want convenience and comfort. But maybe we should flip this on its head and instead seek out that which challenges us.
