# Matthew Swanson personal blog

This is the code for [Matthew Swanson's personal blog](https://www.mps75.net)


## Tech

1. This site is built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).  Everything is basic HTML, CSS, and Markdown.
2. It's hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/); I'm using the
   [GitHub Pages Gem](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/)
   and only the [Jekyll plugins supported on GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/repository-metadata-on-github-pages/)
3. I'm using a modified version of the Jekyll [Swiss theme](https://github.com/broccolini/swiss) created by [broccolini](https://github.com/broccolini)
