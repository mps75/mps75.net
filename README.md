# Matthew Swanson personal blog

This is the code for [Matthew Swanson's personal blog](https://www.mps75.net)


## Tech

1. This site is built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).  Everything is basic HTML, CSS, and Markdown.
2. It's hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/); I'm using the
   [GitHub Pages Gem](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/)
   and only the [Jekyll plugins supported on GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/repository-metadata-on-github-pages/)
3. I'm using a modified version of the Jekyll [Swiss theme](https://github.com/broccolini/swiss) created by [broccolini](https://github.com/broccolini)

## Features

* Mobile-first design ensures this theme performs fastest on mobile while scaling elegantly to desktop-size screens.
* Designed for blogs and sites heavy on written content, with bold typography styles, homepage summaries, and previous/next snippets.
* Supports a wide range of HTML elements and markdown.
* Flexible styles that can be reused for customization without adding additional CSS.
* Dynamically generated navigation links. See docs for adding pages with specific post category for-loops.

## License

The theme is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
